# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to the actual label strings used in this repo's ticket tracker.

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this ticket   |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information   |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent    |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation              |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                       |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the corresponding label string from this table.

Edit the right-hand column to match whatever vocabulary you actually use.

`awaiting-human-review` is not a triage role. It is the local implementation lifecycle status for a ticket or spec whose implementation and required checks are complete and which now awaits human review or acceptance.
