# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists - it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** - read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer discipline (`/domain-modeling`, normally reached through `/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/adr/
|   |-- 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
|   `-- 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
`-- src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root):

```text
/
|-- CONTEXT-MAP.md
|-- docs/adr/                          system-wide decisions
`-- src/
    |-- ordering/
    |   |-- CONTEXT.md
    |   `-- docs/adr/                  context-specific decisions
    `-- billing/
        |-- CONTEXT.md
        `-- docs/adr/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in a ticket title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Keep the glossary focused

`CONTEXT.md` is a domain glossary, not a spec or an implementation guide.

- Keep each definition to one or two sentences that say what the concept is.
- Keep canonical terms, stable domain relationships and `_Avoid_` synonyms.
- Put UI flows, API mechanics, limits, sorting rules and other implementation details in specs and tests.
- Record a decision in an ADR only when it is hard to reverse, surprising without context and the result of a real trade-off.
- Use `/domain-modeling` directly when the glossary needs terminology cleanup without a new product interview.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) - but worth reopening because..._
